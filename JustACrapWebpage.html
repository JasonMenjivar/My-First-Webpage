	<h1>I'm just going to ramble a bit</h1>
	<p>Just for sidenote: I don't know what Im going to talk about so here's a picture of a duck before I start my autistic rambling.

   <p>To start off my rambling, I guess I could say that I need references in order to create my low experienced HTML webpage which I'm too lazy to accomplish. Even though I'm here just saying the most random things that no one would care, this is for a webpage. So for each ramble I'm going to do, I'm just going to post some random pictures as that duck you have recently encountered before. More like a ban-duck. Get it? Ban-duck=Banana duck. Yea, I'm just going to post another picture. </p>

 <p>So I really don't know what in GOD's NAME this picture is. Basically a crab on a plate with Burt Reynolds head as it's head. Pretty cancer right? I'm just finding these pictures on Google Images; the best/worst place for pictures in the history of pictures. Did I mention worst? Yea, the memes you would encounter on that website would make you lose brain cells. To be hoenst, I'm just filling up my HTML webpage with words just to make it longer and look cooler. I ran out of words for this picture since this picture is pretty straight forward so on to the next M O D N A R picture. *insert transition motion here* </p>

 <p>I must have a thing for bananas or if I'm just encountering them too often. If I have a thing for them, I need to seek help and rethink my miserable life. Anyway, instead of a picture, I used a GIF to not bored your mind and soul. Nothing could be worse than a banana peel flying in a circular motion above a bald guy's head right? I might be wrong. OH, and did you see that typo I made in the previous picture? I spelled "honest" incorrectly which I'm too lazy to correct because there's no turning back. I feel like I'm breaking the fourth wall even though I know I am. That didn't make sense. This might get repetitive with just inserting a ramble after ever photo/GIF I include in this worthless HTML. Just keep holding on and I'll figure something out. But for now, here's another cancerous picture since getting a GIF resulted me in losing my sanity. </p>

 <p>I'm still looking for a way to S P I C E things up in my horrible HTML. But let'sfocus on this picture shall we? I mean, google images can't be worse than reddit right? Yea maybe I am right. Or wrong. Judging from this picture, I have doubts that Google Images would ever become a safe haven. Like, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? A chicken costume being worn by a man or just a chicken having human MALE legs? Lol, am I assuming his G E N D E R? OOPS, I assumed it again. Everyone is always just so sensitive when it comes to genders. I think I'm running out of ideas of this whole rambling thing but I'm holding on. I'm also trying my very best to not curse in this HTML since this is suppose to be a constructive, well-informed, webpage. So what I'm going to do is be very optimistic since being pessimistic didn't really work out in the end. I'll brb while I learn new things about this CSS crap. But for now, just enjoy yourself looking at this Chicken Man or Man Chicken running through the blissful fields of grass in black or white.   </p>
